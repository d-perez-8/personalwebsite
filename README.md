This is the first website I have created and hosted. Used HTML for the content and structure. CSS for styling and formatting. JavaSript for functionality. I chosed Netlify for its simpliciy and reputation amoungst free teir web hosting. My goal was to create a simple degined website for others to see my previous work and experience, to offer my services to others, and to make the site responsive.

## Optimizations

When I go back to improve the site, I would like to add more design to the background or include more colors since I think the black background can be too simple. I would also like to add more of my projects when I finished developing client websites.

## Lessons Learned:

One of the lessons I have learned is to carefully design the website to how you want it before coding. There were times where I kept changing my mind on how I wanted it to look, but I went with a simple design, because I wanted to have it online for people to see. Another lesson I have learned is to always make sure the website it responsive. If I shared someone my website, they would most likely see it on their phone. So it better look good no matter what device!
